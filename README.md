## Terms of use
1. Use at your own risk.  I can't guarantee that the API will always be up, and sometimes the structure of requests and responses will change.
2. Predicting the future is hard.  Sometimes forecasts won't be accurate.  I constantly make improvements to the core algorithm, largely based on issues in the existing one.
3. If you make use of Spitcast's data in a public way, please provide attribution.  It doesn't need to be a big mention.  Just mention it somewhere.
4. Whatever you build, please don't call it Spitcast.  For example, if your name is Jimmy and you build an Android app, don't name it Spitcast in the Play Store.  Name it something like "Jimmy's Surf App" and then mention that it's powered by Spitcast in the description or something.
5. Share what you've built.  I love seeing the different ways this data can be used.
